                Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates
                <br>
                <br>
                Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by
                feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a
                four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from
                the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. There are about ten thousand
                living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose
                development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and
                elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further
                evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic
                island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
                Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further
                evolved for swimming.

                roughly the size of a human hand, and they're incredibly sharp. Harpy eagle talons are very strong and

            <p class="paragraph">
                Vultures are relatively silent as they lack a syrinx so they can only hiss, growl, and snarl. They are
                predominantly scavengers but will occasionally kill small animals that are sick or dying. However, they
                will not eat a carcass that is more than a few days old as it become putrid.

                Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and
                nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural
                hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Peafowl is a common name for three bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the tribe
                Pavonini of the family Phasianidae, the pheasants and their allies. Male peafowl are referred to as
                peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, even though peafowl of either sex are often
                referred to colloquially as "peacocks".

                The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally of the Indian subcontinent, and the
                green peafowl of Southeast Asia; the one African species is the Congo peafowl, native only to the Congo
                Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls and their extravagant plumage. The latter is
                especially prominent in the Asiatic species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert
                feathers, which they display as part of a courtship ritual.

                pigeon, any of several hundred species of birds constituting the family Columbidae (order

                Pigeons occur worldwide except in the coldest regions and the most remote islands. About 250 species are
                known; two-thirds of them occur in tropical Southeast Asia, Australia, and the islands of the western
                Pacific, but the family also has many members in Africa and South America and a few in temperate Eurasia
                and North America. All members of the family suck liquids, rather than sip and swallow as do other
                birds, and all pigeon parents feed their young “pigeon’s milk,” the sloughed-off lining of the crop, the
                production of which is stimulated by the hormone prolactin. The nestling obtains this “milk” by poking
                its bill down the parent’s throat.

            <p class="paragraph">
                chicken, (Gallus gallus), any of more than 60 breeds of medium-sized poultry that are primarily
                descended from the wild red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus, family Phasianidae, order Galliformes) of India.
                The chicken is perhaps the most widely domesticated fowl, raised worldwide for its meat and eggs.

                Despite the chicken’s close relationship with the red jungle fowl, there is evidence that the gray
                jungle fowl (G. sonneratii) of southern India and other jungle fowl species, also members of Gallus, may
                have contributed to the bird’s ancestry. There is some debate about what the chicken’s scientific name
                should be. Although many taxonomists and ornithologists consider it as a domesticated form of the wild
                red jungle fowl, some classify it as a subspecies of the red jungle fowl (i.e., G. gallus domesticus),
                whereas others, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, classify the bird as G. domesticus.
